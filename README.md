# movie-origin-prediction
A NLP project to classify a movie plot into three categories based on origin

Using the TensorFlow Machine Learning library and a movie plots dataset from Kaggle, I create a NLP model to classify a movie into three 
categories: 'American', 'British', or 'Bollywood'. The model takes as input the plot of the movie, and returns the class as output.

The final model has over 85% accuracy on the test set. You can also test the model with your own plots!
